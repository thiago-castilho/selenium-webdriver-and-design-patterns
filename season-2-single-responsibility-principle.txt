3. PROBLEMS WITH POOR DESIGN
    Class:
        - A class represents a real world entity
        - Classs consists of properties/members and behaviors/methods
        - Class level properties are being shared among all the methods of the class
            - If a method modifies a property, other methods using the property might produce different output

    Sometimes the problmes can be simple, and some if blocks should be enough. But, when we receive new rules for the app, it mighr be a problem if we hadn't a pattern.
