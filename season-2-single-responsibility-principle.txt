3. PROBLEMS WITH POOR DESIGN
    Class:
        - A class represents a real world entity
        - Classs consists of properties/members and behaviors/methods
        - Class level properties are being shared among all the methods of the class
            - If a method modifies a property, other methods using the property might produce different output

    Sometimes the problmes can be simple, and some if blocks should be enough. But, when we receive new rules for the app, it mighr be a problem if we hadn't a pattern.

4. GOOD CODE VS BAD CODE
    - Good and Bad code might produce same output
    - Bad Code:
        - Quick to develop
        - Less initial effort
        - More maintenance effort
        - Difficult to introduce a change & require thorough testing for all the functionalities of the class
        - Mostly patch work with if-else blocks
    - Good Code:
        - More initial effort
        - Less maintenance
        - Easy to introduce new change
        - Comes with experience/knowledge

5. Single Responsibility Principle - Introduction
    - When a class if modified, all the responsibilities need to be tested.
    - Testing effort is the total number of responsibilities of all the classes being modified.
    - To minimize effort, minimize the responsibilities.

    Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
        - A class should have onle one responsibility/ one reason to chance.
        - SRP isn't only for classes. It can be used on Micro/Macro services too.
        - Another example of SRP: Docker is used to packege one single application process along with dependencies

6. Coupling & Cohesion
    - Highly cohesive
    - Loosely coupled

    Coupling is the measure of the degree of the dependencies among classes/modules
        - Highly coupled: too many dependencies (A class/module can not work without another class/module)
            The problem of Login Page is a good sample (First video of this course, the web driver works just with chrome driver)
        - Loosely coupled - less dependencies

    Cohesion is the measure of the degree of the relationship of the members within a class/module
        - High cohesion: all the members of a class are very closely related. They are related to single responsibility.
            The problems of salary promotion in the second example ilustrates that. First, when we had just one role, the cohesion was High. Then, when we add a lot of roles with if-else block, we had low cohesion.
        - Low cohesion: members are not related.
